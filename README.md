HOW TO DOWNLOAD?
Click on dist, then on Vortex.exe, it will put you on a "this file is too big" page. click the 3 dots, and click download. or just press ctrl + shift + s if you cant find it. (sorry for it being messy, first time using github.)

Why is it 451MB?
It uses tesseract OCR, which takes up a lot of space (i need to pack it into the program so it works for everyone with a single download)
